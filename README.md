# queueLearning

## Introduction
This repository provides a practical task assignment solution to maximize payoffs in online service platforms where the platform has very limited information of incoming clients. It is potentially very useful for early stage platforms as a practical solution to matching the "client" to the most suitable "server" on the platform. 

The algorithm beautifully balances the exploration-and-exploitation tradeoff while guaranteeing system stability to achieve near-optimal system payoff. In particular, the proposed solution incorporates online learning and adaptive control capability in a queueing system so that the solution applies to situations with unknown client arrival rates, unknown client/server-dependent payoffs, unknown number of tasks/trials from clients, and even unknown service rate at servers.

## Usage
The codes provide a working example to simulate a 2-server sytem for the proposed algorithm.
